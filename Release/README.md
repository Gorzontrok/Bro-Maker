BroMaker allows you to load custom bro mods into the game and provides modders with a library to greatly decrease the difficulty of adding custom bros to the game.

## Bugs and Issues

## Installing Custom Bros

See the Custom Bros sections on [this guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2434812447).

To play with a Custom Bro, click on it in the BroMaker mod GUI, and click Load Bro. Or you can enable automatic spawning and set a chance to spawn with a custom bro in the mod settings, by default custom bros have the same chance to spawn as normal bros.

## Known Issues

- Custom bros don't work online
