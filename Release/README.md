Or you can enable automatic spawning and set a chance to spawn with a custom bro in the mod settings, by default custom bros have the same chance to spawn as normal bros.

## Unlocking Custom Bros

Some custom bros have unlock requirements, such as rescuing X bros or playing their unlock level. To check if a bro is unlocked or what needs to be done to unlock them, you can go to the custom bros menu.

Go to the avatar of the custom bro you want to try to unlock and press fire.

Then you can check their unlock requirements and play their unlock level if they have one. If they have an unlock level and have a required rescue amount then you can choose either method to unlock them.
